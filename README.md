## Pre-setup Utilities

A few of my favorite updates to make my command line work (and look) the way I like.

__Bash Profile__ (`~/.bash_profile`)
* Color and Prompt mods (coming soon)
* Check Versions mod (`~/.ckver`)

__Bash Aliases__ (`~/.bash_aliases` coming soon)
* Mods for `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd`
* Mods for `ssh`, `sftp`, and `rsync`
* Mods for `apache`, `php`, `atom`, and `mysql`

__Bash RC__ (`~/.bashrc` coming soon)
* Mods for `PATH`, `HOME`, etc.

__Git__ (`~/.git/` coming soon)
* Mods for `.git-config`

__Manage Node and NPM with NVM__ (coming soon)
* How my setup works for me.
* Maybe it will work for you too.
